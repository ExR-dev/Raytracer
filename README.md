# Raytracer
 A raytracing renderer made from scratch. 
 Partially done as a 3D programming assignment, which can be seen in the "RaytracerAssignment" subfolder.
 Everything in the root folder is my own personal project.
 
 You will need to set up SFML manually. Additionally, The shader does not work on all GPUs.
