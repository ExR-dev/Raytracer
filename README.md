# Raytracer
 RaytracerAssignment: A very simple cpu-based raytracer without any form of lighting. Made for a 3D programming assignment.

 RaytracerSFML: GLSL-based raytracer rendered using SFML 2.6.0. It implements a mostly adequate lighting model with support for emission, reflection & refraction, gloss, absorption and more. It also supports cumulative rendering and many other small features. You will need to add SFML to PATH. Additionally, the shader seemingly does not work on all computers as it cannot be read by SFML on my laptop.

 RaytracerDX11: Work-in-progress HLSL-port of RaytracerSFML.
